Can you tell me if the price of the washing machine will change when it's back in stock?\\n\\nAgent: The price of the washing machine may change when it's back in stock.

It's been more than a week, and I'm getting frustrated.\\n\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me check the status of your refund. May I have your order number and registered email address, please?\\n\\nCustomer: Sure, my order number is 123456 and my email address is john.doe@email.com.\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for the information, John.

The refund should reflect in your account within the next 3-5 business days.\\n\\nCustomer: Why does it take so long? I returned the product a week ago, and I need the money urgently.\\n\\nAgent: I understand your concern, John. However, the refund timeline for Cash on Delivery returns is slightly longer than other payment methods. This is because we need to verify the returned product's condition before processing the refund to ensure that it's in its original condition.\\n\\nCustomer: Okay, I see. But I still need the money urgently. Is there anything you can do to expedite the process?\\n\\nAgent: I'm sorry, John, but we cannot expedite the refund process.
